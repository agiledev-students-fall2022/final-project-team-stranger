## Product Vision Statement

1.  **Stay Anonymous, Stay Kind.**

    Users are always anonymous on our platform. No pressure, no blush.

2.  **Building a mental bridge connecting strangers.**

3.  **We build what we build.**

    Aiming at building a compact app avoiding all kinds of trouble and mess.
