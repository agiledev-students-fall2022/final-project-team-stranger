# Team Stranger

We plan to build a mobile/web application that collects and shares kind words. A user can receive and share one message every day. The message can be a small paragraph, a quote, a simple line, or even a single word.

## Product Vision Statement

1. **Stay Anonymous, Stay Kind.**

   Users are always anonymous on our platform. No pressure, no blush.

2. **Building a mental bridge connecting strangers.**

   Users might be strangers in real life, but are connected with each other and support one another here through sending kind words.

3. **We build what we build.**

   Aiming at building a compact app avoiding all kinds of trouble and mess.

4. **Warm Others, Warm yourself.**

   Users will see how influential their words become. Achieve happiness and encouragements through cheering others up.
